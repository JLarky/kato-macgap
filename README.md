# Kato macgap

This project is wrapper around https://kato.im using [macgap](http://github.com/maccman/macgap) framework, which provides more native Mac OS experience like growl notifications and Dock icon.


## Building app

First you need to install [macgap generator](http://github.com/maccman/macgap-rb).

Then just run

    make

After that you can run `kato` app or use installer generated to `image/Kato.dmg`
